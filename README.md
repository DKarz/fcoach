A browser application “Fcoach” was made. Its aim is developing speciﬁc skills of football players. This tool allows to optimize the training process in terms of improving the visual psychomotorics of the player, expanding the area of his peripheral vision and developing the ability to control the situation outside of direct eye contact. 


One of the differences that draw a line between a middling and good football player is awareness on the pitch. Even though the best way to develop this skill is regular game practice, by using auxiliary software awareness can be improved during individual training sessions as well. 

It often happens that even a skillful player is “eaten” by defenders if he lacks football awareness. Football is such a game where players who are under the most pressure have to receive the ball with their backs to the opponents’ goal and defenders. If a player while receiving the ball looking only at it, then two scenarios are very likely – the ball will be lost or the player will protect the ball with the body tightly or moving back that decrease the pace of the attack.  Therefore, while receiving the ball the player should check the situation over his shoulder. 

The application represents a website that every three seconds shows a random integer number up to 10 on a background in which color is chosen randomly out of four possible colors: red, blue, green, orange. Such a variety allows to make up a bunch of different training drills for improving touch, dribbling, and the main one awareness.

There are presented just a few examples of using the app. As the following gif shows, as the player receives or passes the ball, he should check the situation. During the training process, it is can be useful to shout out what you see on the screen.

As light warming up exercise, a player can focus only on the color shown by the tablet. Comparing with saying the color which can be seen “with the edge of the eye”, numbers require much more attention.

The application may also help to train other aspects of the game such a moving towards cone if, say, the red color on the screen.

Personally, I noticed that it brings more fun to the training process. To increase the difficulty, the exercises mentioned above can be modified – for example move to the right if the number is even and left otherwise.
